## How to view my recent work
The ideal place to find all my current work is on my [portfolio](https://www.christopherprobertson.com/).

On occasion I also post what I am working on in my [twitter](https://twitter.com/Koltonix) too.

## Misc
My primary programming language these days are C++ and C#.

I'm always happy to contribute to modding or open-source projects if it's of interest to me!
